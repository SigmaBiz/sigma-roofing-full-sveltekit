They not only did everything they promised â€” they went above and beyond in every way. In today's world, it's rare to find a team this honest, thorough, and committed to true customer service. I had the pleasure of working with Antonio, and he has truly restored my faith in humanity.",

      review: "I highly recommend BBAV Roofing, LLC. Antonio Escalante was awesome to work with. Their quality of work is great. They replaced my roof, gutters, garage door and did some painting and I am 100 percent happy with everything. No high-pressure sales techniques, which was really nice after talking to some other roofing companies.",

      review: "Antonio and his crew did an Outstanding job getting us back into our house after the November Tornado. He helped us with every aspect of the damage: drywall, roof, chimney, carpet, tile, garage door, and other interior needs. We are extremely pleased with the results and he is great to work with. Will never use anyone else.",

      review: "I had tornado damage on November 3rd and they were next door putting a tarp on my neighbors house. Without hesitation they came to my assistance. They put a tarp up and reinforced my roof and patiently checked in on me while I had a public adjuster helping me fight the insurance company. Me and three of my neighbors are extremely grateful we have bbav as our roofing company.",
